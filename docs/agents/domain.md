# Domain Docs

How the engineering skills should consume this repo's domain documentation when exploring the codebase.

**This repo uses the single-context layout** — one `CONTEXT.md` at the repo root is the glossary for the whole app. Although the code is split into `frontend/` and `backend/` folders, they model the same domain and share one ubiquitous language, so there is one glossary, not one per folder.

## Before exploring, read these

- **`CONTEXT.md`** at the repo root — the project's domain glossary.
- **`docs/adr/`** at the repo root — past architectural decisions. Read the ADRs that touch the area you're about to work in.

If any of these files don't exist, **proceed silently**. Don't flag their absence; don't suggest creating them upfront. The producer skill (`/grill-with-docs`) creates them lazily when terms or decisions actually get resolved.

## File structure

Single-context repo (this repo):

```
/
├── CONTEXT.md                 ← the one glossary for the whole app
├── docs/adr/                  ← architectural decisions
│   ├── 0001-....md
│   └── 0002-....md
├── frontend/
└── backend/
```

If this repo later grows a genuinely separate context (an area with its own distinct language — e.g. a billing/subscriptions domain), introduce a `CONTEXT-MAP.md` at the root pointing to per-context `CONTEXT.md` files at that point, and update the summary above.

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When your output names a domain concept (in an issue title, a refactor proposal, a hypothesis, a test name), use the term as defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Don't drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If the concept you need isn't in the glossary yet, that's a signal — either you're inventing language the project doesn't use (reconsider) or there's a real gap (note it for `/grill-with-docs`).

## Flag ADR conflicts

If your output contradicts an existing ADR, surface it explicitly rather than silently overriding:

> _Contradicts ADR-0007 (event-sourced orders) — but worth reopening because…_
